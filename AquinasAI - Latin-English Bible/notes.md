- A toggle where you can select all Latin or all English or a third option where you can enter a mode where Latin is black and English is italicized and in gray under it. And then when you select the English, the English is black and the Latin is italicized and a bit gray and you can kind of toggle between them. So you can either have Latin, English, or English and Latin and those are three options.
